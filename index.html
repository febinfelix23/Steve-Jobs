                <div class="divider"></div>

                <p>Apple Inc. (formerly Apple Computer, Inc) is an American multinational technology company
                    headquartered in Cupertino, California. As of March 2023, Apple is the world's largest company by
                    market capitalization, and with US$394.3 billion the largest technology company by 2022 revenue. As

                    manufacturing company by revenue; and the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. It
                    is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet

                <div class="divider"></div>

                <p>NeXT, Inc. (later NeXT Computer, Inc. and NeXT Software, Inc.) was an American technology company
                    headquartered in Redwood City, California that specialized in computer workstations for higher
                    education and business markets, and later developed web software. It was founded in 1985 by CEO
                    Steve Jobs, the Apple Computer co-founder who had been forcibly removed from Apple that year. NeXT
                    debuted with the NeXT Computer in 1988, and released the NeXTcube and smaller NeXTstation in 1990.
                    The series had relatively limited sales, with only about 50,000 total units shipped. Nevertheless,
                    the object-oriented programming and graphical user interface were highly influential trendsetters of
                    computer innovation.</p>

                <div class="divider"></div>

                <p>Pixar started in 1979 as part of the Lucasfilm computer division. It was known as the Graphics Group
                    before its spin-off as a corporation in 1986, with funding from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs who
                    became its majority shareholder. Disney purchased Pixar in January 2006 at a valuation of $7.4+
                    billion by converting each share of Pixar stock to 2.3 shares of Disney stock. Pixar is best known
                    for its feature films, technologically powered by RenderMan, the company's own implementation of the
                    industry-standard RenderMan Interface Specification image-rendering API. The studio's mascot is Luxo
                    Jr., a desk lamp from the studio's 1986 short film of the same name.</p>

                <div class="divider"></div>

                <p>The Mac, short for Macintosh (its official name until 1999), is a family of personal computers
                    designed and marketed by Apple Inc. The product lineup includes the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro
                    laptops, and the iMac, Mac Mini, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro desktops. Macs are sold with the macOS
                    operating system.Jef Raskin conceived the Macintosh project in 1979, usurped and redefined in 1981
                    by Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. The Macintosh, with a 9-inch monochrome monitor built into the case,
                    was introduced by the "1984" advertisement during Super Bowl XVIII, and launched January 1984. In
                    1987, the Macintosh II brought color graphics, and from 1994, Power Macintosh transitioned from
                    Motorola 68000 series processors to PowerPC.</p>
